	                <h4><br>1.Examine the plants carefully before buying</br>
	                <br>Sometimes a plant which looks healthy from the top may have a rotten root which will kill the whole plant in no time. Make sure that the root is white and firm and spaced all over the root ball and avoid the dark ones.</br>
	                <br>2. Use a yard paste that is fully composted</br>
	                <br> While you are using a yard paste, be sure that is fully composted.So, you must be very careful and inspect properly before using any such waste in your plants especially on the plants that are very sensitive.</br>
	                <br>3. Keep it clean and tidy</br>
	                <br>Keep your garden clean all through the year especially during the fall.since during falls your garden gets most dirty, you must be more careful that time. Remove all the dead leaves properly as if you keep them, then it will actually infect the fresh leaves that will come out in spring and slowly infect your full garden.</br>

	               </div>
	                <br>4. Use fertilizers carefully</br>
	                <br>The best is to go organic and avoid fertilizers when possible. Use natural fertilizing agents like compost etc. But if you choose to use fertilizers, then you better be careful. Fertilizers are definitely good for your plants but sometimes, if you are not careful, you may go wrong there as well.</br>
	               
	                <br>5. Prune the damaged limbs properly</br>
	                <br>It is very important that your prune and trim the plants properly and at the right time. This is mainly due to the facts that the limbs that are wounded may actually give a way to occurrence of diseases.</br>
	                <br>6. Arrange and plant the trees properly</br>
	                <br>If you want to do proper gardening then you must arrange and place your trees properly as per their sunlight requirements and it is certainly one of the easiest ways to maintain your garden and keep it healthy.</br>

	                <br>7. Water your plants properly</br>
	                <br>Water is life and just like us, plants also need adequate water to survive. But the quantity of water you are giving is important. Too little or too much water may affect the health of the plant. So, you must be aware of the water requirements.Try to water the roots only and take up techniques to limit the accumulation of moisture on a plant’s foliage and hence avoid overhead sprinkling.</br>
	                <br>8. Do not crowd the plants</br>
	                <br>It is very important that you do not plant the trees in your garden in a crowded manner and this is one of the most essential tips I can give you to maintain your garden at home. There are several reasons behind.Place the plants with sufficient gap between them and improve the airflow around the plants.</br>
	                <br>9. Over to you</br>
	                <br>Plants are very important part of our lives as they help us in many ways and keep our environment clean by checking the pollution.A well-organized garden besides enhancing the beauty of the homealso helps create a good impression of the owner.</br></h4>
	                

	                <h5>How to design a garden? </h5>

	                 <h4><br>1. PLAN FOR WHAT YOU WANT AND NEED</br>
	                <br>Establishing a design brief of what you want and need from your garden space is essential and therefore the first step of your garden planning process.</br>
	                <br>2. DECIDE WHAT TO CHANGE AND WHAT CAN REMAIN</br>
	                <br>  Spend time looking critically at the garden and both its good and bad points before developing a new ‘masterplan’</br>
	                <div class="img-box">

	               </div>
	                <br>3. UNDERSTAND GARDEN DESIGN COSTS</br>
	                <br>Even if you keep some existing features, completing even a small garden with a relatively simple design for less than £6,000 to £7,000 can be challenging once design fees, materials, plants and employing contractors are factored in.</br>
	                <br>4. THEN, SET THE BUDGET FOR YOUR GARDEN DESIGN</br>
	                <br>A new-look garden can be very expensive, especially when it comes to modern garden designs, where a clean finish is essential.Work out how much you can afford to spend and see where you can make savings easily. </br>
	                <br>5. DECIDE WHETHER TO HIRE A GARDEN DESIGNER</br>
	                <br>Do not have experienced friends or family to call on when you need to know how to lay decking for example – consider hiring a garden designer. They will help in all areas of your gardening design project, and can save you money in the long run.</br>
	                <br>6. OR, LEARN HOW TO DESIGN A GARDEN YOURSELF</br>
	                <br>Designing a garden yourself is a satisfying, pocket-friendly option which will allow you to get really creative. There are so many resources and even garden design apps available to help you.</br>

	               </div>
	                <br>7. UNDERSTAND GARDEN ASPECTS</br>
	                <br>North-facing gardens, South-facing gardens,West-facing gardens, East-facing gardens, Find the best garden plant ideas for your soil type too.</br>
	                <br>8. CONSIDER GARDEN MAINTENANCE</br>
	                <br>Specific wants and needs vary from person to person, but ask yourself, ‘how do I want to feel?’ and ‘who is the garden for?’ along with considering how much time you have for garden maintenance.</br>
	                <br>9. THINK ABOUT THE TIMESCALE</br>
	                <br>This depends on the scale of your project, however, not everything needs to be completed at once.Think about the seasons, too. Most gardening and landscaping work is carried out between spring and early autumn, when nights are shorter and the weather is warm. The best planting season is early- to-mid spring and early-to-mid autumn.</br>
	                <br>10. CHECK IF YOUR GARDEN DESIGN REQUIRES PLANNING PERMISSION</br>
	                <br>For most garden projects, it isn’t necessary to apply for planning permission, but you will need to in certain cases – extending boundary heights, extensive terracing, decking platforms above 30cm and new paving in the front garden being the most common examples.</br></h4>

	                 <h4><br>1. Potatoes </br>
	                <br>A fun crop to grow Plant potatoes during late February and March in potato bags that are only part filled with compost. When the green shoots begin to appear above the soil, simply cover them with more compost. Repeat until the bag is full, and then you only need remember to water them! The real fun comes at the end of the season, 10 to 20 weeks later when the foliage starts to yellow and die back. Tip the bag out and rummage around in the soil to collect up your own home grown potatoes. Potatoes are such easy vegetables to grow at home!</br>

	                <br>2. Peas</br>
	                <br>  Peas are a trouble free crop that enjoy cooler weather. Sow them directly into the ground from March to June and look forward to the incredible sweet flavour of fresh picked peas from June to August. All they need is support for their stems - simply erect some chicken wire or netting between supports at each end of the row. You'll be amazed at how good fresh peas taste - and the more that you pick them, the more they produce!</br>

	                <br>  ive your salads a tangy crunch with some quick-growing spring onions. Companion planting with mint will help to deter onion fly. Try 'White Lisbon' for a crop that'll overwinter, or 'Performer' for a milder taste.</br>

	                <br>  Onions and garlic are virtually maintenance-free crops, and are such easy vegetables to grow. Simply plant onion bulbs and individual garlic cloves on well drained soil in spring or autumn - then leave them to it! In late summer when the foliage yellows and dies back, you can lift them and dry them in the sun before storing them.</br>

	                <br>5. Tomatoes</br>
	                <br>  Tomato plants are so quick that you can almost watch them grow, so they are the ideal easy vegetable for kids to cultivate. Choose a bush variety like 'Romello' that can be planted in hanging baskets and window boxes. Bush varieties don't require training or side-shooting, so you only need to feed and water them before the fruit starts to pour from the plant</br>
